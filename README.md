## ðŸš€ Usage & Deployment of Advanced Features

### 1. **Automated Indexing & Management**

- Use the Express API (`scripts/api.js`) to trigger, schedule, and manage repo indexing jobs.
- Indexing jobs are enqueued to Azure Service Bus and processed asynchronously by `scripts/queue_worker.js`.
- All summaries, tags, embeddings, and logs are stored in MongoDB for historical access, analytics, and semantic search.

### 2. **API Endpoints**

- `POST /index` â€” Enqueue a new indexing job (optionally for a specific org).
- `GET /index.json` â€” Retrieve the latest index from MongoDB.
- `GET /errors` â€” Retrieve recent error logs from MongoDB.
- `POST /webhook` â€” GitHub webhook trigger for event-driven indexing.
- `POST /create-repo` â€” Create a new GitHub repository.
- `GET /audit-permissions/:org/:repo` â€” Audit repo collaborators.
- `POST /upload-index` â€” Upload index files to Azure Blob Storage.
- `POST /semantic-search` â€” Semantic search for relevant repos by natural language query.
- `GET /docs` â€” Interactive OpenAPI/Swagger documentation.

### 3. **Semantic Search Usage**

- **Endpoint:** `POST /semantic-search`
- **Body:** `{ "query": "your search text", "top": 5, "org": "optional-org", "language": "optional-language", "tags": ["optional", "tags"] }`
- **Returns:** Top N most relevant repos (summaries, tags, links) based on semantic similarity and optional filters.
- **Example:**

  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/semantic-search \
    -H "x-api-key: <your-key>" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"query": "machine learning pipeline", "top": 3, "org": "my-org", "tags": ["ml"]}'
  ```

### 4. **Backfilling Embeddings**

- To ensure all existing repos are searchable, run:

  ```bash
  node scripts/backfill_embeddings.js
  ```

- This script will generate and store embeddings for any repo missing them in MongoDB.

### 5. **Vector Database (Scalable Search)**

- For large-scale or high-performance search, **Azure Cognitive Search** is fully integrated.
- The indexing pipeline upserts embeddings and metadata into the Azure Cognitive Search index.
- The semantic search endpoint uses Azure Cognitive Searchâ€™s vector similarity for fast, scalable results.
- To ensure all data is up-to-date for Azure Cognitive Search, run:

  ```bash
  node scripts/upsert_azure_search.js
  ```

- You can also integrate with Pinecone or MongoDB Atlas Search by adapting the upsert/search logic in the pipeline.

### 6. **Advanced Query Handling**

- The semantic search endpoint supports filtering by org, language, and tags.
- Results are scored and sorted by semantic similarity using Atlas Search.

### 7. **Monitoring & Analytics**

- All search queries and results are logged for analytics and improvement.
- Add metrics for search latency, embedding generation, and API usage as needed.

### 8. **Extensibility & Documentation**

- See `/docs` endpoint for live API docs.
- See `README_API.md` for detailed API and deployment instructions.
- Add more usage examples and document the embedding model and search logic as needed.

**Get started:**

1. Install dependencies: `pnpm install`
2. Configure `.env` with your secrets and connection strings.
3. Start the API: `pnpm start` or `node scripts/api.js`
4. Start the queue worker: `pnpm worker` or `node scripts/queue_worker.js`
5. (Optional) Backfill embeddings: `node scripts/backfill_embeddings.js`
6. (Optional) Upsert for Atlas Search: `node scripts/upsert_atlas_vector_schema.js`
7. Access API docs at `http://localhost:3000/docs`

**Available scripts in `package.json`:**

- `pnpm start` â€” Start the API server
- `pnpm worker` â€” Start the queue worker
- `pnpm dev` â€” Start the API server with auto-reload (requires `nodemon`)
- `pnpm lint` â€” Lint the codebase (requires `eslint`)
- `pnpm test` â€” Run tests (placeholder)
- `pnpm build` â€” Build step (placeholder)

For cloud deployment, build and run the Docker image, and use the Bicep template to provision Azure resources.
